### Ignoring lines
It is possible to opt out of canipls warnings for specific lines of code. This is done via various magic comments:

| comment text | function |
| - | - |
| `canipls-ignore` | Ignore the line this comment is found on |
| `canipls-ignore-nextline` | Ignore the line following the one this comment is found on |
| `canipls-ignore-file` | Ignore the whole file if this comment is found anywhere therein |
| `canipls-ignore-start` | Start ignoring from this line |
| `canipls-ignore-end` | Stop ignoring after this line |

#### Examples
```css
/* canipls-ignore-nextline */
@starting-style {
    /* ... */
}
```

```javascript
const now = Temporal.Now.instant(); // canipls-ignore
```

## Config
`canipls` will search the following places for configuration options, in order of precedence:
1. a file called `.canipls.cfg` in the current project's root directory
2. a file called `canipls.cfg` in the user's global app config directory
    - on Windows, this is found at `%HOME%/AppData/Roaming/canipls/`
    - on macOS and Linux, this is found at `~/.config/canipls/`
3. use the default values (see below table)

The following configuration options are available:

| name | type | default | description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `support_threshold` | number | `90.0` | The minimum global browser support threshold, according to caniuse, that features must meet |
| `show_low_support_warnings` | boolean | `true` | Whether to show warning diagnostics for features that fall below the desired support threshold. (If this is set to `false`, `support_threshold` has no effect.) |

Config files are simply plain text files containing one or more of the above config options, separated by newlines, with key/value pairs separated by a space:
```
support_threshold 80.0
show_low_support_warnings true
```
