VS Code extension wrapper around [canipls](https://github.com/taylorplewe/canipls).

# canipls
[![Tests CI results](https://github.com/taylorplewe/canipls/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/taylorplewe/canipls/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

(Pronounced "can I please", á la [gopls](https://go.dev/gopls/))

A language server that shows [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com) support percentages for web features, right in your editor.

![canipls demo](https://whencaniuse.com/gh/canipls-demo-js.gif)

Implements the following features of Microsoft's [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol):
- **diagnostics** - shows warnings on features whose global support percentage falls below the user-defined desired support threshold (or the default, if none is specified.)
- **hover** - hover over any native HTML element, global attribute, CSS at-rule, property, psuedo-selector, JavaScript API or buultin, to see its global support percentage.

Supported file types:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript/Typescript
- JSX/TSX
- Vue
- Svelte
- Astro

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While global support percentages in canipls rarely match 1:1 those of caniuse's, _they are never more than 1% off_, and rarely more than about 0.1% off. canipls data is refreshed once a day, but caniuse.com does not divulge all of its data sources.

## Usage

### Ignoring lines
It is possible to opt out of canipls warnings for specific lines of code. This is done via various magic comments:

| comment text | function |
| - | - |
| `canipls-ignore` | Ignore the line this comment is found on |
| `canipls-ignore-nextline` | Ignore the line following the one this comment is found on |
| `canipls-ignore-file` | Ignore the whole file if this comment is found anywhere therein |
| `canipls-ignore-start` | Start ignoring from this line |
| `canipls-ignore-end` | Stop ignoring after this line |

#### Examples
```css
/* canipls-ignore-nextline */
@starting-style {
    /* ... */
}
```

```javascript
const now = Temporal.Now.instant(); // canipls-ignore
```

## Config
`canipls` can be configured, and upon startup, will search the following places for configuration options, in order of precedence:
1. a file called `.canipls.json` in the current project's root directory
2. a file called `canipls.json` in the user's global app config directory
    - on Windows, this is found at `%HOME%/AppData/Roaming/canipls/`
    - on macOS and Linux, this is found at `~/.config/canipls/`
3. use the default values (see below table)

The following configuration options are available:

| name | type | default | description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `support_threshold` | number | `90.0` | The minimum global browser support threshold, according to caniuse, that features must meet |
| `show_low_support_warnings` | boolean | `true` | Whether to show warning diagnostics for features that fall below the desired support threshold. (If this is set to `false`, `support_threshold` has no effect.) |
| `ignored_feature_ids` | string[] | `[]` | List of caniuse feature IDs (without the `mdn-` prefix) which should be ignored when throwing warning diagnostics; may include a trailing `*` wildcard |

<details>
<summary>Where can I find a feature's caniuse ID?</summary>

Search for the feature you want on caniuse.com, and click the big `#` button to the left of the feature card:

The caniuse feature ID is the URL following "`caniuse.com/`", but canipls is only concerned with what follows `mdn-`:

</details>

Example:
```json
{
    "support_threshold": 80.0,
    "show_low_support_warnings": true,
    "ignored_feature_ids": [
        "css_properties_cursor_*",
        "javascript_builtins_temporal"
    ]
}
```
